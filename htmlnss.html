In keeping with the sole aim of the NSS, Raghu Engineering College is associated with National Service Scheme to provide hands on experience to young students in delivering community service. Instilling the spirit of service and promoting active participation in the government led community service activities; Raghu Engineering College has created opportunity for our students to become NSS Volunteers.<br><br>

Helping students expand out of intellectual luxury and inspired from the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi of involving students in service activities, Raghu Engineering College has been associated with NSS from 2009. Since its inception with a team of 1 Program Officer and 50 Student Volunteers the unit has been actively rendering services in coordination with JNTUK NSS Cell and has grown to the size of 3 units with each unit constituting of 1 Program Officer and 100 student volunteers adding up to 300 Student Volunteers. Of the 3 units of NSS, one is funded by JNTUK NSS Cell and the rest 2 are self-financed by Raghu Engineering College. The cardinal principle of the programme is that it is organized by the students themselves and because of their active participation in social service they get a sense of involvement in the tasks of national development. This has been helping our students identify social problems and developing a sense of civic responsibility.<br>
